</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>I've just hit the four week mark since starting my new job at surround.io. It has been awesome. </p>
<h2>Coding</h2>
<p>I am coding more than I ever did at Microsoft, and I'm learning so many different things along the way. Just last week, these are some of the things I worked on/with/learned/explored:</p>
<ul>
<li>C++</li>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Protobuf</li>
<li>GStreamer</li>
<li>Unix Domain Sockets</li>
<li>... and the many tangential things you learn along the way</li>
</ul>
<p>It's been a whirlwind of technology, design, consideration, and it's been great. Exhausting at times, but I'd take it ANY DAY over the many monotonous days I had at Microsoft.</p>
<h2>Receptiveness</h2>
<p>During my time at Microsoft, one of the big reasons I decided to jump ship was a lack of receptiveness to my ideas. Here, I can voice my opinion, and people listen. And hey, sometimes those ideas even get implemented! Even non-technical ideas. </p>
<p>A small, simple example: when I started, everyone used email and other random means of communication (text messaging, iMessage, etc) to keep in touch. Since people were often in-and-out of the office, I suggested we start using Hipchat. Now we use Hipchat! The end! It feels great to know that I can provide ideas, feedback, etc, and be heard. At a big place like Microsoft, this is much harder to do, and it really wore on me.</p>
<h2>Environment</h2>
<p>Natural lighting. City atmosphere. Walking to work. Open  space. It's great.</p>
<h2>Day-to-Day</h2>
<p>All-in-all, I feel happier. That's for sure. Here's a funny caveat though: I'm not really sure what we're doing. And in fact, I'm not even sure that anyone knows what we're doing. We're sort of figuring it out as we go. There are prototype ideas and some basic milestones we've set, but as for our real goal and direction, a lot remains to be decided.</p>
<p>But with our short-term goals and prototype milestones, I've been able to keep myself busy. I'm coding, learning,  and and making an impact (at least with my peers). Where this thing goes, only time will tell. But one month in, I believe I made a good decision to join.</p>
