</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>The next big turn in my life is joining a startup company. What do I want to get out of it? </p>
<h2>Accelerated and Diversified Learning</h2>
<p>I'm only in my third year as a professional software engineer. I'm not yet looking to specialize, because the field is so broad and so many areas interest me. It's very possible that I haven't even discovered a new area that really speaks to me yet.</p>
<p>With so much to do, an aggressive timeline, and so few people to do it all, you can bet that I'll be working on a lot of different aspects of the product. Here are some technical areas I'd like to grow in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linux (generally, and developing for)</li>
<li>Networking (distributed systems, protocols, p2p/mesh)</li>
<li>Computer Vision / Graphics</li>
<li>Machine Learning (know nothing about this now!)</li>
<li>Firmware/drivers</li>
<li>Security (encryption, privacy) </li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond the technical learnings, I am eager to learn about product development. How will we go from an idea, to an experiment, to a prototype, to a product? </p>
<p>I had good exposure to development processes at Microsoft. I know that I'll be able to employ some of that at Surround.io, but it will also be valuable to me to compare that with the development processes we forge ahead with. I'll be able to understand:</p>
<ul>
<li>What did Microsoft do well? </li>
<li>What could have Microsoft improved upon?</li>
<li>What scales, or does not scale, from a tiny company to a mega-corporation?</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, I hope to learn about business development and entrepreneurship. Perhaps one day I would like to found my own company. This opportunity will hopefully offer some insight into the process of building a company. </p>
<h2>Greater Impact and Influence</h2>
<p>As I mentioned in my previous post, something that I strongly desire is the ability to impact and influence the product. My motivation is in making the product better, and making the experience better for those who use it. </p>
<p>For me, being passionate about what I'm working on takes full engagement. I want to be developing, I want to be using, and I want to be improving. </p>
<p>Frequently I will offer my opinions, my ideas, and my feedback in the hopes of improving upon what we have. On some level, I just want to be heard. I want to know that others value what I have to say, and from time to time, will take action on that feedback.  </p>
<p>I'm not always right, and I'm certainly not the only one with an opinion, but <strong>there's no quicker way to kill my passion than to disregard my ideas</strong>, or offer me no opportunity to contribute my ideas. A discussion about why we cannot (or should not) do something goes a long way compared to a stonewall.</p>
<p>I'm confident that working in a small startup will provide me with an environment that welcomes ideas and feedback. We can't afford to fail like Microsoft can (and by the way, Microsoft's definition of failure, i.e. project cancellation, is quite different than a startup's definition of failure), and I think the active participation by our employees in the growth, development, and direction of the product is likely to be key to our success.</p>
<h2>A Stronger Network</h2>
<p>I interned at Tesla Motors, and it was one of the best experiences of my life. It was a bootstrap for my career, and it's been so amazing to see where my cohort of interns as well as full time employees of the era have gone in their careers since then.</p>
<p>At Microsoft, the way in which people disperse couldn't have been more different. Because of its enormity, people tend not to leave! They just find another group within the company. At Microsoft it seems as if your network grows within the company, but rarely outside of it.</p>
<p>I'm excited to meet new folks in my new job outside of Microsoft (though, admittedly they're all ex-Microsoft!), but it will be great to see what connections and opportunities that I will be able to forge through them as time goes on. The founders of Surround.io are incredible experienced and talented, and to be able to grow my network with/through them will be immensely valuable to me in the future as my career progresses. </p>
<h2>Success! Or, Failure</h2>
<p>If we work hard, and we build something awesome, and the stars align in such a way that provides us with some amount of success, then I'll be a happy camper. Anyone would be. </p>
<p>But what if we fail? After all, most startups do. We've got some greatly experienced folks on board from both a business perspective and a technical perspective, but it isn't a guaranteed ticket to success. </p>
<p>Personally, I'm of course going to do everything in my power to contribute to our success. But in the end, that might not be enough. And that's ok. Either way, I'm going to learn a lot along the way, work with some great folks, and I'll simply have to move on to the next adventure, whatever that might be.</p>
<p>Either way, I'm confident I'll come out of it in so many ways for the better, and that's great.</p>                </article>
